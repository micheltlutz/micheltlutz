### [Michel Lutz](https://micheltlutz.me)

Hello. My name is Michel, Currently I work as Tech Manager being responsible for the knowledge base and structure of Innovation Studio Modern Applications and Mobile App at [Compass.UOL](https://compass.uol).
With 18 years of experience in software development and mobile app architecture, I have a passion for data and AI.


Currently, I'm maintaining two open-source repositories. The first is the "jumper" library, an independent open-source framework written in Swift. Soon, it will have a Python version. Unlike other market-available web frameworks or toolkits like Vapor, Kitura, Perfect, FastAPI, Flask, etc., "[jumpper](https://github.com/micheltlutz/jumpper)" can stand alone or be used alongside any of them. It showcases the simplicity of building HTML pages using just Swift and Python. This library's intent is to ease the creation of static or dynamic pages. Roughly a decade ago, I developed a similar library in a different language, which expedited numerous projects. I've decided to introduce these concepts to the language I now use. The project is ongoing, and I welcome collaborations, suggestions, forks, and sharing. I hope it aids many developers.

The other repository I oversee is "[dev-challenge](https://github.com/micheltlutz/dev-challenge)." It's a software development challenges repository, allowing one to enhance coding skills by implementing real-world problem solutions.

This project is tailored to reinforce the studies of professionals in web, mobile, and back-end development, presenting a plethora of practical challenges.

For front-end developers, we offer a ready-to-use API set up to run in a Docker environment. This API comprises routes for listings, authentication, user creation, login, and more, enabling the developer to mainly focus on design and interface implementation.

The challenge for back-end developers is to replicate the pre-built routes in their preferred programming language and then create relevant documentation.
