### [Michel Lutz](https://micheltlutz.me)

Hello. My name is Michel, Currently I work as Tech Manager being responsible for the knowledge base and structure of Innovation Studio Modern Applications and Mobile App at [Compass.UOL](https://compass.uol).
With 18 years of experience in software development and mobile app architecture, I have a passion for data and AI.


At present, I maintain two open-source code repositories. The first one is the [Winged-Python](https://github.com/micheltlutz/Winged-Python) library, an independent open-source framework written in Python. Soon, it will have a new version written in Swift, replacing the old project called 'jumpper.' Unlike other web frameworks or toolkits available in the market, such as Vapor, Kitura, Perfect, FastAPI, Flask, etc., 'Winged-Python' can stand alone or be used in conjunction with any of them. It demonstrates the simplicity of building HTML pages using Swift and Python alone. The purpose of this library is to streamline the creation of both static and dynamic web pages. About a decade ago, I developed a similar library in a different language, which sped up several projects. I decided to introduce these concepts into the languages I currently use. The project is a work in progress, and I welcome contributions, suggestions, forks, and shares. I hope it helps many developers.

The other repository I oversee is "[dev-challenge](https://github.com/micheltlutz/dev-challenge)." It's a software development challenges repository, allowing one to enhance coding skills by implementing real-world problem solutions.

This project is tailored to reinforce the studies of professionals in web, mobile, and back-end development, presenting a plethora of practical challenges.

For front-end developers, we offer a ready-to-use API set up to run in a Docker environment. This API comprises routes for listings, authentication, user creation, login, and more, enabling the developer to mainly focus on design and interface implementation.

The challenge for back-end developers is to replicate the pre-built routes in their preferred programming language and then create relevant documentation.
