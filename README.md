## 🚀 About Me

Hi! I'm **Michel Lütz**, a father, husband, and **Technical Pre-Sales & Mobile Solutions Architecture Expert** with over **20 years of experience** in technology.

I work within the **[AI/R Company ecosystem](https://aircompany.ai/en/home/)** — a global innovation group focused on Artificial Intelligence — where I serve as a key reference for mobile architecture and technical pre-sales, supporting all group companies in the design, evolution, and validation of AI-oriented mobile solutions.

### 🎯 My Main Responsibilities:

- **Defining and validating cross-platform mobile architectures** (iOS, Android, Flutter, React Native) aligned with microservices, scalable APIs, and AI integrations
- **Leading global technical pre-sales initiatives**, transforming business requirements into clear and sustainable architectural solutions
- **Supporting multiple AI/R companies** in modernizing mobile applications and implementing Server-Driven UI and super-app ecosystems
- **Providing technical mentorship** to leaders and engineers, reinforcing engineering excellence, scalability, and system design practices
- **Collaborating with product, engineering, and AI teams** to accelerate critical deliveries, optimize workflows, and create high-impact digital experiences
- **Developing internal frameworks and reference guides** to standardize mobile solutions at a global scale

As an entrepreneur, I founded and led **Masters MX**, a company dedicated to web and mobile development, and I continue to apply that innovative mindset in every new project.

Beyond technology, I'm passionate about **motorcycling, photography, and 3D printing**, which I share with my wife through [Casa Vivaro](https://casavivaro.com.br), our 3D design and lifestyle brand.

## 🛠️ Open Source Projects

### [Winged-Swift](https://github.com/micheltlutz/Winged-Swift) 🦅
> **Swift framework for static and dynamic HTML generation**

An innovative framework that allows you to create static websites using only Swift, with no external dependencies. Perfect for developers who want to leverage Swift's simplicity for web development.

```swift
// Usage example
let page = HTML(children: [
    Head(children: [
        Title(content: "My Site"),
        Link(rel: "stylesheet", href: "/style.css")
    ]),
    Body(children: [
        H1(content: "Hello, World!")
    ])
])
```

### [Winged-Python](https://github.com/micheltlutz/Winged-Python) 🐍
> **Independent Python framework for HTML generation**

Similar to Winged-Swift, but for Python. Can be used standalone or integrated with frameworks like FastAPI, Flask, Django, etc.

### [dev-challenge](https://github.com/micheltlutz/dev-challenge) 💻
> **Software development challenges repository**

Practical challenges for front-end, back-end, and mobile developers, with ready-to-use APIs in Docker for development focus.
