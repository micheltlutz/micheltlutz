### [Michel Lutz](https://micheltlutz.me)

Hello. My name is Michel, Currently I work as Tech Manager being responsible for the knowledge base and structure of Innovation Studio Modern Applications and Mobile App at [Compass.UOL](https://compass.uol).

- Chapters
- Learning trails
- accelerators and research & development

With the challenge of managing these fronts for approximately 850 employees who make up the Innovation Studio today and for the new employees who will come from our scholarship programs.

With more than 15 years of experience in software development and building architecture for mobile applications.
I have an MBA in Data Science for Business from PUCRS. I already teach Scrum training in Rio Grande do Sul.

I have several certifications in managing agile, scalable, people management and scale framework projects.
In preparation for ITIL 4 certification
AWS Cloud Practitioner certification and in preparation for AWS Solutions Architect certification


I am currently focused on the [jumpper library](https://github.com/jumpper/jumpper).
Is an open source framework, which is independent of other web frameworks or toolkits available on the market, such as Vapor, Kitura and Perfect. It can be used in conjunction with any of them and even alone. This shows how simple it is to build HTML pages using only Swift.
The idea of this library is to facilitate the creation of static or dynamic pages.
About 10 years ago I developed a library similar to this one, but in another language, it streamlined many projects that I developed.
I decided to bring these concepts to the language I use today.
The project is still under development, feel free to collaborate and leave suggestions, fork and share.
I hope it will be useful for more developers.
